            I was born on October 15th 2002 in Miami Florida. From a very young age,
            I became invested in drawing. Being able to create anything I could imagine
            on a sheet of paper excited me. As I grew older, I became aware of more powerful
            tools that allowed for more types of expression. Technology opened my eyes to the fact 
            that art has a large amount of digital mediums to explore, and I wanted to experience them all.
            My interests lie in computer animation, game design, 3D modeling, and so much more. Additionally,
            Technology is such a massive part of my life, and I want to become extremely effecient in using
            it to its fullest potential. Besides art, some of my hobbies include skateboarding, tennis,
            and gaming.
